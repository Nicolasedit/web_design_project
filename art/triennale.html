            <strong>Triennale</strong><br>
            The Triennale di Milano is a design and art museum in the Parco Sempione in Milan, in Lombardy in northern Italy. It is housed in the Palazzo dell'Arte, which was designed by Giovanni Muzio and built between 1931 and 1933; 
            construction was financed by Antonio Bernocchi and his brothers Andrea and Michele.
            The Milan Triennial, an international exhibition of art and design, was held at the museum thirteen times between 1936 and 1996, and - after a break of twenty years - again in 2016.
            Since 2003 the Triennale has awarded the triennial Gold Medal for Italian Architecture.
            A permanent museum of Italian design, the Trienniale Design Museum, was opened in 2007.
            It hosts design, architecture, and the visual, scenic and performing arts.
            The building houses a theatre, the Teatro dell'Arte, which was also designed by Muzio.
            In 2019, the XXII Triennale was celebrated under the title "Broken Nature", focusing on design approaches that explore the relations between humans, nature and other species.
