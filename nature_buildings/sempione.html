            <strong>Simplon Park</strong><br>
            Simplon Park is a large city park in Milan. 
            Established in 1888, it has an overall area of 38.6 hectares (95 acres), and it is located in the historic centre of the city, inside the Zone 1 administrative division.
            The park is adjacent to the gardens of the Sforza Castle and to the Arch of Peace, two of the main landmarks of the city. 
            The very design of the park, due to architect Emilio Alemagna, was conceived with the intent of creating panoramic views encompassing both monuments. 
            <br>A third prominent monument of Parco Sempione is the Palazzo dell'Arte ("Palace of Art"), built in 1933 and designed by Giovanni Muzio, which currently houses the Triennale di Milano art expo.
            The Sempione Park is located where the Visconti ducal park or "Barcho" was once located.<br>
            Near the Sforzesco Castle, the park was enlarged and enclosed by the Sforza to become more than 3 million square meters in area. 
            <br>The park was a forest composed mainly of oaks and chestnut woods and inhabited by exotic animals introduced by members of the house of Sforza.
