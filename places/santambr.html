            <strong>Basilica of St.Ambrouse</strong><br>
            One of the most ancient churches in Milan, it was built by St. Ambrose in 379-386, in an area where numerous martyrs of
            the Roman persecutions had been buried. The first name of the church was in fact Basilica Martyrum.
            <br>In the centuries after its construction, the edifice underwent several restorations and partial reconstructions, 
            assuming the current appearance in the 12th Century, when it was rebuilt in the Romanesque style.<br>
            Initially, the basilica was outside the city of Milan, but over the following centuries, the city grew up around it.<br> 
            It became a centre of religious life and a community of canons developed in the church. 
            In 789, a monastery was established within the basilica grounds. <br>The canons, however, retained their own community and identity instead of fading away. 
            Two separate, distinct religious communities shared the basilica. In the 11th century, the canons adopted a rule of life and became Canons Regular. 
            There were now two separate monastic communities following different rules living in the basilica. 
            The canons were in the northern building, the cloister of the canons, while the monks were in the two southern buildings.
