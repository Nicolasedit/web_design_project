            <strong>Royal Palace of Milan</strong><br>
            The Royal Palace of Milan was the seat of government in the Italian city of Milan for many centuries. 
            Today, it serves as a cultural centre and it is home to international art exhibitions.
            It spans through an area of 7,000 square meters and it regularly hosts modern and contemporary art works and famous collections
            in cooperation with notable museums and cultural institutions from across the world.<br>
            More than 1,500 masterpieces are on display annually.
            It was originally designed to include two courtyards but these were later dismantled to make room for the Duomo. 
            The Palazzo is located to the right of the Duomo's facade, opposite to Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II.<br> 
            The facade of the Palazzo creates a recess in Piazza del Duomo which functions as a courtyard, known as the Piazzetta Reale.
            The famous Hall of Caryatids can be found on the main floor of the building, heavily damaged by World War II's air raids. 
            After the war the Palazzo remained abandoned for over two years and its condition further deteriorated. 
            Many of the Palazzo's neoclassical interiors were lost in this period.
