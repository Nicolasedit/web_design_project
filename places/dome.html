            <strong>Metropolitan Cathedral of the Nativity of Saint Mary</strong><br><br>
            Milan Cathedral, or Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary, is the cathedral church of Milan, Lombardy, Italy. 
            Dedicated to the Nativity of St Mary, it is the seat of the Archbishop of Milan, currently Archbishop Mario Delpini.<br>
            The cathedral took nearly six centuries to complete: construction began in 1386, 
            and the final details were completed in 1965.<br>
            It is the largest church in the Italian Republic — the larger St. Peter's Basilica is in the State of Vatican City — possibly the second largest in Europe and the third largest in the world.
            Milan's layout, with streets either radiating from the Duomo or circling it, reveals that the Duomo occupies what was the most central site in Roman Mediolanum, 
            that of the public basilica facing the forum. 
            The first cathedral, the "new basilica" dedicated to St Thecla, was completed by 355. 
            It seems to share, on a slightly smaller scale, the plan of the contemporaneous church recently rediscovered 
            beneath Tower Hill in London. An adjoining basilica was erected in 836.<br> 
            The old octagonal baptistery, the Battistero Paleocristiano, dates to 335 and still can be visited under the cathedral. 
            When a fire damaged the cathedral and basilica in 1075, they were rebuilt as the Duomo.
